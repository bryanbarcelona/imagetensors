Guidance / Important Notes
--------------------------
• This project is released under the MIT License (see LICENSE). That applies
  only to code authored by Bryan Barcelona in this repository.

• GPLv3 components (czitools, readlif):
  - You may declare MIT for your project while listing GPLv3 packages as
    runtime dependencies (e.g., in requirements), **only if**
    you do not distribute, bundle, or vendor the GPLv3 code with your project.
  - If you include, modify, or redistribute GPLv3-licensed source or binaries
    together with your code, the distribution triggers GPLv3 obligations.

• BSD 3-Clause components:
  - Keep and ship the copyright and license notices for these packages as
    required by BSD-3-Clause.

• Where to put full texts:
  - It is recommended to include full license texts in a `LICENSES/` folder:
      LICENSES/BSD-3-Clause.txt   (copy of BSD 3-Clause)
      LICENSES/GPL-3.0.txt        (copy of GPLv3)
  - Keep each dependency’s copyright & license file as shipped when possible.

Suggested quick checklist before release
---------------------------------------
1. Confirm you do not vendor/copy any GPLv3 source into your repo.
2. If you vendor any dependency, include that dependency’s exact license text
   and respect its attribution requirements.
3. If you plan to distribute binaries/packages that include GPLv3 components,
   plan to relicense the distribution under GPLv3 and include GPLv3 source
   and notices as required.

Contact / Verification
----------------------
• You may produce a `LICENSES/` folder with the standard BSD-3-Clause and GPLv3 texts,
  and individual small license note files for each dependency.
• You may generate a final NOTICE that substitutes `<Your Project Name>` with the actual
  project name and inserts exact upstream URLs for each dependency.
